# Disease-Prediction-Model

This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system developed using Python and popular data science libraries. Using a trained classifier, the model takes user input of symptoms and predicts the most likely disease.

📌 Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can diagnose diseases based on reported symptoms. This can be used as an initial diagnostic tool in healthcare applications to assist doctors or individuals in understanding potential health issues.

🚀 Features:

Input-based symptom checker

Machine learning classification model

Clean and interactive Jupyter Notebook

Accuracy evaluation and prediction examples

Can be adapted to real-world healthcare applications

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

Seaborn / Matplotlib

🧠 How It Works:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and symptoms are encoded appropriately.

Model Training: A classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) is trained on the symptom-disease mapping.

Prediction: The model takes symptoms as input and predicts the most probable disease.

Evaluation: Accuracy and performance metrics are computed to evaluate the model.
